## Key Principles

**Clarity**: Any team member should instantly know what's in each file and folder.

**Separation of Concerns**: 
- Governance = admin, processes, backlog tracking
- Development = code, architecture, setup guides

**Version Control**: Issue files and process docs are committed to git for historical tracking and traceability.

**Automation**: Backlog synchronization runs via GitHub Actions and PowerShell scripts to maintain canonical state.

## Backlog Management

The backlog is managed through:
1. **Canonical Catalog**: Single source of truth in `scripts/create_github_backlog.ps1`
2. **GitHub Issues**: Live issues synced from the catalog
3. **Tracking Files**: Snapshots in `backlog-tracking/` for documentation

To synchronize the backlog with GitHub:
```powershell
Set-Location "Tesoreriaygerenciade-negocios"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\create_github_backlog.ps1 `
  -Repo "CSA-DanielVillamizar/Tesoreriaygerenciade-negocios" `
  -BacklogPath "C:\Path\To\backlog"
```
